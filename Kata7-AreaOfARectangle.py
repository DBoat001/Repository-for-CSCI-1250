'''First, it checks if the diagonal is less than or equal to the side. If so, 
it returns "Not a rectangle" since that's not possible.
If valid, it uses Pythagorasâ€™ theorem to calculate the missing side of the rectangle.
Then it multiplies the two sides to get the area.
Finally, it rounds the result to two decimal places and returns it.
